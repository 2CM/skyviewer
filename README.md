# hello :)

This project is basically just a [Skycrypt](https://sky.shiiyu.moe/) clone I'm making to practice/learn some [next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [react](https://reactjs.org) stuff.

Something about taking some API data and displaying it in a cool way sounds cool to me. and I'm going to try to take as much skyblock API data as I can and display as much of it as possible.
